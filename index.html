            <p>
               My current job is washing windows all around the Columbus, Ohio area. I enjoy my job, but would eventually
               like to find one in coding. So far I have learned quite a bit with HTML, CSS and a brief introduction to
               JavaScript. I plan on taking these skills, along with new ones I learn along the way and switching careers!
