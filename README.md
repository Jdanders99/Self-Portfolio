# Jakob's Portfolio

## Description

I made this as a template or potential edit for later to use as a portfolio of my work. Will be useful in job searching or even just to show people what I'm capable of! Slowly but surely learning how to become a web designer/coder.

## Usage

Just for my own personal use, to make it easier for people to see my accomplishments of coding/web design. Will update or use as a template for a later date and make it look more professional!
